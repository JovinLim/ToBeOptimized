# ToBeOptimized
TBO (To Be Optimised) aims to enable efficiency in hospital design by helping healthcare architects to generate layouts based on authority guidelines and advice from medical planners, and optimise layouts based on pedestrian simulation throughout the generated spaces. 

The project consists of a downloadable plugin for Revit which automatically generates layouts based on a selected floor plan and a website which showcases the plugin. The technical aspects include the use of C# to interact with Revit API, Python for optimisation algorithms and HTML / CSS for the website showcase. Rhinoceros and Grasshopper was initially used to visualize outputs from tests of procedural generation algorithms.
